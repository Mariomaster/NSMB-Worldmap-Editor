# NSMB-Worldmap-Editor
Download the compiled version: http://www.mediafire.com/download/ignd6p1qca686oq/NSMB+Worldmap+Editor.zip

To run the editor you have to put the "Supporting Files" folder in the the same directory as the .exe
You also have to do that while debugging.

I also give credit to the creators of NSMBe for using a few (maybe 15) lines of code from them
